        <h1>about this site</h1>
        <p>This is version 2.0 of notetakingappformycca!</p>
        <h2>What does it do</h2>
        <p>This is a browser app that allows you to store notes such that you can keep track of tasks and manage your productivity, or just to remind yourself of upcoming events. You can create a new note on the Notes page. (WARNING: may not function properly on all devices)</p>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>There is a variety of things you can do to your notes on this website. For example, you can set a title, colour, date, description text as well as the text colour which will be displayed in your note below the Notes dashboard. You can use these inputs to customise your note and personalise them. With dates set in notes, you can see the amount of days till your big event (or a deadline). Don't worry, you will always be able to see your notes when you come back! In addition, notes will come with a delete button in case you don't need them anymore.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a note you can create with this app.</p>

        <p><b>[VERSION 2.0]</b> In addition, you can now add categories to your notes section! You can create notes within categories, or move already existing notes that are uncategorised or in other categories into these categories. You can choose the text colour and background colour of your category, and when you delete it, the notes inside will move out into the uncategorised section.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a category containing notes.</p>

        <h2>Site preferences</h2>
        <p>If you go to the Site Preferences page, you can customise the site as well! Right now you can only customise the background color gradient and the two text colours, but it's still pretty cool. Follow the instructions on that page to find out more.</p>
